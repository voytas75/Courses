- KQL Basics: Learn the syntax, operators, functions, and data types in KQL.

    KQL Basics:

    Syntax:
    Kusto Query Language (KQL) uses a simple and intuitive syntax for querying and analyzing data. The basic structure of a KQL query consists of three main clauses: the data source, the operators and functions for data manipulation, and the result output. A typical KQL query looks like this:

    ```sql
    [DatabaseName] [TableName]
    | [Operation1]
    | [Operation2]
    ...
    | [ResultOutput]
    ```

    Operators:
    KQL supports a variety of operators for performing operations on data. Some common operators include:

    1. Comparison Operators: Used to compare values. Examples include `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal), and `>=` (greater than or equal).

    2. Logical Operators: Used to combine conditions. Common logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.

    3. Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic arithmetic operations. Examples include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division).

    4. In Operators: Used to check if a value is present in a set of values. For example, `in (value1, value2, ...)`.

    Functions:
    KQL provides a wide range of built-in functions for data manipulation and analysis. Functions can be used to perform various tasks, such as aggregations, date and time manipulations, string operations, and more. Some common functions include:

    1. Aggregation Functions: Used to summarize data, e.g., `sum()`, `avg()`, `count()`, `min()`, and `max()`.

    2. Date and Time Functions: Used to work with date and time values, e.g., `datetime_add()`, `datetime_diff()`, `format_datetime()`, etc.

    3. String Functions: Used for string manipulation, e.g., `strlen()`, `tolower()`, `toupper()`, `substring()`, and `trim()`.

    4. Mathematical Functions: Used for mathematical calculations, e.g., `sqrt()`, `log()`, `exp()`, etc.

    Data Types:
    KQL supports several data types, and it's important to understand them to work effectively with the language. Some common data types in KQL include:

    1. Int: Integer data type, representing whole numbers (e.g., 1, 42, -10).

    2. Real: Floating-point data type, representing decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0).

    3. Bool: Boolean data type, representing true or false values.

    4. String: Text data type, representing sequences of characters (e.g., "hello", "world").

    5. DateTime: Data type representing date and time values (e.g., datetime(2023-07-23 12:34:56)).

    6. Dynamic: A data type that can store different types of data, similar to JSON objects.

    7. Guid: Data type representing a globally unique identifier (e.g., guid("3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301")).

    It's worth noting that KQL is case-insensitive, meaning keywords and function names can be written in uppercase or lowercase interchangeably.

    By understanding the basic syntax, operators, functions, and data types in KQL, you'll be able to construct powerful queries to analyze and manipulate data effectively within Azure Sentinel or any other environment that uses Kusto Query Language.
- Querying Azure Sentinel Data: Explore how to write queries to retrieve and filter security logs and events from various data sources.

    Querying Azure Sentinel Data:

    Azure Sentinel uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query and analyze security logs and events from various data sources. To retrieve and filter data effectively, you can follow these steps:

    1. Choosing the Data Source:
    In Azure Sentinel, data is organized into tables, and each table contains specific types of data. The first step is to identify the appropriate table(s) that contain the data you want to query. Some common data tables in Azure Sentinel include SecurityEvent, Heartbeat, OfficeActivity, AzureActivity, etc.

    2. Basic Query Structure:
    Start by specifying the data source (table) you want to query using the `datatable` operator. The basic query structure looks like this:

        ```sql
        datatable(Column1: DataType1, Column2: DataType2, ...)
        ```

    3. Retrieving Data:
    To retrieve data from the selected table, use the `project` operator. This operator selects specific columns from the data table to include in the query result. For example:

        ```sql
        datatable(TimeGenerated: datetime, SourceIP: string, EventID: int)
        | project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, EventID
        ```

    4. Filtering Data:
    To filter data based on specific criteria, use the `where` operator. This allows you to define conditions that must be met for data to be included in the query result. For example, filtering events with EventID 4624 (logon events):

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4624
        ```

        You can also use logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4624 and AccountType == "User"
        ```

    5. Time-Based Filtering:
    Azure Sentinel stores data with a timestamp (TimeGenerated) that indicates when an event occurred. You can use time-based filtering to query data within specific time ranges. For example:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where TimeGenerated >= datetime(2023-07-01) and TimeGenerated < datetime(2023-07-15)
        ```

    6. Aggregations:
    To perform aggregations on the data, you can use functions like `sum()`, `count()`, `avg()`, etc. This allows you to summarize data and gain insights into patterns or trends.

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4624
        | summarize TotalLogonEvents = count() by Computer, Account
        ```

    7. Sorting:
    To sort the query results, you can use the `order by` operator. For example, sorting events by their TimeGenerated in descending order:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | order by TimeGenerated desc
        ```

    8. Limiting Results:
    By default, queries return a limited number of results. To control the number of results returned, you can use the `limit` operator.

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | limit 100
        ```

    By combining these techniques, you can construct powerful queries to retrieve and filter security logs and events from various data sources within Azure Sentinel. Remember that KQL provides a wide range of functions and operators, allowing you to perform complex data analysis and gain valuable insights into your organization's security posture.

### Day 2

- Advanced KQL Queries: Dive deeper into advanced querying techniques, including aggregation, joins, subqueries, and time-based analysis.

    Advanced KQL Queries:

    1. Aggregation:
        Aggregation in KQL allows you to summarize and group data based on certain criteria. Common aggregation functions include `sum()`, `count()`, `avg()`, `min()`, and `max()`. You can use the `summarize` operator to perform aggregation. For example:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize TotalEvents = count() by EventID
        ```

    2. Joins:
        Joins in KQL enable you to combine data from multiple tables based on a common field. The `join` operator is used for this purpose. For instance, suppose you have two tables, SecurityEvent and FirewallEvent, and you want to correlate them based on the SourceIP field:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | join kind=inner FirewallEvent on $left.SourceIP == $right.SourceIP
        | project TimeGenerated, $left.SourceIP, $right.Action
        ```

    3. Subqueries:
        Subqueries allow you to use the results of one query as input to another query. You can enclose a query within parentheses and use it in a larger query. For example, you can use a subquery to filter specific events:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID in (subquery | summarize count() by EventID | where count_ > 100 | project EventID)
        ```

    4. Time-Based Analysis:
        Time-based analysis is crucial in security monitoring. KQL provides functions to work with date and time, such as `datetime_add()`, `datetime_diff()`, and `bin()`. The `bin()` function is useful for aggregating data into time intervals. For instance, you can aggregate the number of events per hour:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize TotalEvents = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
        ```

        Additionally, you can use the `ago()` function to define time ranges relative to the current time. For example, to retrieve events from the last 24 hours:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
        ```

    5. Advanced Filtering:
        KQL supports more complex filtering with regular expressions using the `matches` operator. This allows you to search for patterns in string fields. For example, to find events where the SourceIP starts with "192.168":

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where SourceIP matches regex "^192\.168\."
        ```

    6. Statistical Analysis:
        KQL enables statistical analysis using functions like `percentile()`, `stdev()`, and `histogram()` to gain insights into data distributions and anomalies. For instance, to calculate the 95th percentile of the EventDuration field:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize p95_EventDuration = percentile(EventDuration, 95)
        ```

    7. Custom Functions:
        KQL allows you to define custom functions with the `function` keyword. This can be helpful for encapsulating complex logic and reusing it across queries.

    Remember that advanced KQL queries can become more complex, and it's essential to test and validate them to ensure accurate results. Additionally, take advantage of Kusto Query Language documentation and sample queries to enhance your skills and proficiency in crafting sophisticated queries for in-depth security analysis in Azure Sentinel or any other Kusto-based system.
- Analyzing Security Data: Learn how to analyze security logs and perform common security investigations using KQL in Azure Sentinel.

    Analyzing Security Data using KQL in Azure Sentinel:

    1. Security Incident Investigation:
    When investigating security incidents, you may want to filter and analyze logs related to specific events or suspicious activities. Use the `where` operator to filter data based on relevant criteria and focus on the event types and time frames of interest. For example:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4624 and AccountType == "User"
        | where TimeGenerated >= datetime(2023-07-15) and TimeGenerated < datetime(2023-07-22)
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, IPAddress, Target, EventID
        ```

    2. Detecting Anomalies:
    Use statistical functions like `percentile()`, `stdev()`, or `rangemap()` to detect anomalies in the data. For example, to find unusually high event counts for a specific EventID:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize EventCount = count() by EventID, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
        | where EventCount > percentile(EventCount, 99)
        ```

    3. User Activity Analysis:
    Analyzing user activity is crucial for identifying suspicious behavior. You can use joins to correlate data from different tables to investigate user actions and their impact. For example:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID in (4624, 4625)  // Logon and Logoff events
        | join kind=inner Heartbeat on $left.Computer == $right.Computer
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, RemoteIPCountry, ResultDescription
        ```

    4. Geographic Analysis:
    Use the `geoip` plugin to perform geographic analysis on IP addresses. This can help identify suspicious logins or activity from unexpected locations:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID in (4624, 4625)  // Logon and Logoff events
        | extend IPAddressCountry = tostring(parse_json(geoip(IPAddress)).countryName)
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, IPAddress, IPAddressCountry, ResultDescription
        ```

    5. Malware and Threat Hunting:
    Create custom detection rules using KQL to hunt for specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) and malware patterns. Use functions like `contains()`, `has_prefix()`, or `has_suffix()` to identify suspicious values in log fields. For example:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4688 and CommandLine contains "malware.exe"
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, CommandLine
        ```

    6. Timelines and Event Sequencing:
    Use `order by` and `project` operators to create timelines of events for specific entities or accounts. This can help reconstruct activities and identify patterns in a chronological order.

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where Account == "user123" or Account == "admin"
        | order by TimeGenerated asc
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, EventID, Computer
        ```

    7. Cross-Data Source Analysis:
    Combine data from different tables or sources using joins to perform more comprehensive analysis. For instance, correlating Azure Activity logs with SecurityEvent logs can help identify suspicious activities related to Azure resources:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | join kind=inner AzureActivity on $left.Resource == $right.Resource
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, Resource, OperationName, ResultType, TimeGenerated1
        ```

    These are just a few examples of how KQL can be used to analyze security logs and conduct common security investigations in Azure Sentinel. As you become more proficient in KQL, you can craft more complex queries and leverage advanced functions and techniques to gain deeper insights into your organization's security posture and detect potential threats more effectively.
- Threat Detection and Hunting: Discover how to leverage KQL to detect threats, create custom detection rules, and conduct proactive threat hunting.

    Threat Detection and Hunting using KQL in Azure Sentinel:

    1. Threat Detection with Custom Rules:
    Azure Sentinel allows you to create custom detection rules using KQL to identify specific threat indicators or patterns in your data. Custom detection rules can be defined in the Analytics section of Azure Sentinel. Here's an example of a custom rule to detect multiple failed logon attempts from a single IP address:

        ```sql
        // Custom rule: Multiple Failed Logon Attempts from a Single IP
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon event
        | where AccountType == "User"
        | summarize FailedLogonAttempts = count() by IPAddress
        | where FailedLogonAttempts >= 5 // Threshold for multiple failed logon attempts
        | project IPAddress
        ```

    2. Analyzing Security Events for Anomalies:
    Use KQL to analyze security events and detect anomalies in the data. For instance, you can identify abnormal spikes in the number of failed logon attempts:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon event
        | summarize FailedLogonAttempts = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
        | where FailedLogonAttempts > percentile(FailedLogonAttempts, 95)
        ```

    3. Proactive Threat Hunting:
    Proactive threat hunting involves actively searching for suspicious activities or unknown threats that may not be covered by existing rules. KQL allows you to conduct proactive hunting by combining various data sources and applying advanced filters. For example, you can hunt for instances of code execution across multiple machines:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID in (4688, 592, 7045) // Process creation events
        | where CommandLine contains_any("powershell.exe", "cmd.exe", "mshta.exe")
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, CommandLine
        ```

    4. Correlation Rules:
    Use KQL to create correlation rules that identify patterns of events or activities that may indicate a potential threat. For example, you can correlate failed logon events with subsequent account lockouts:

        ```sql
        let failedLogons = SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon event
        | summarize count() by Computer, Account;
        
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4740 // Account lockout event
        | join kind=inner (failedLogons) on Computer, Account
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, EventID
        ```

    5. Threat Intelligence Integration:
    Integrate threat intelligence feeds into your queries to enrich your analysis. You can use external data tables or APIs to match IP addresses, URLs, or file hashes against known threat indicators. For example:

        ```sql
        let threatIntel = externaldata (Category: string, Indicator: string)
        [@"URL_TO_THREAT_INTEL_CSV"]
        with (format="csv");
        
        SecurityEvent
        | join kind=leftouter threatIntel on $left.RemoteIPCountry == $right.Indicator
        | where isnotnull(Category)
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, RemoteIPCountry, Category
        ```

    By leveraging KQL in Azure Sentinel, you can develop sophisticated detection rules, perform proactive threat hunting, and conduct in-depth analysis of security events and logs. KQL's flexibility and expressive power empower security analysts to stay vigilant against potential threats and enhance their organization's overall security posture.

### Day 3

- Visualizing Data with KQL: Explore techniques to visualize query results and create interactive dashboards using KQL and Azure Sentinel workbooks.

    Visualizing Data with KQL in Azure Sentinel:

    Kusto Query Language (KQL) in combination with Azure Sentinel workbooks allows you to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present your query results. Here are some techniques to visualize query results and build interactive dashboards:

    1. Using `render` Operator:
        The `render` operator is used to visualize the query results in different chart types, such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc. You can use functions like `summarize` or `pivot` before the `render` operator to aggregate and shape the data for visualization. For example:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon events
        | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
        | render timechart
        ```

    2. Customizing Charts:
        You can customize the appearance and behavior of charts using additional parameters in the `render` operator. For example, you can add titles, legends, tooltips, change colors, and adjust chart size:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon events
        | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
        | render timechart title="Failed Logon Events" legend=true tooltips=true chartsize=300
        ```

    3. Creating Pie Charts:
        Use the `summarize` operator to create data sets for pie charts and the `render` operator with `piechart` parameter to visualize the data:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | summarize EventCount = count() by EventID
        | render piechart
        ```

    4. Building Tables:
        Use the `project` operator followed by the `render` operator with `table` parameter to display query results as a table:

        ```sql
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon events
        | project TimeGenerated, Account, IPAddress, EventID
        | render table
        ```

    5. Combining Visualizations:
        You can use multiple `render` operators in a single query to create a dashboard with multiple visualizations:

        ```sql
        let loginAttempts = SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon events
        | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h);
        
        let lockouts = SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4740 // Account lockouts
        | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h);
        
        union loginAttempts, lockouts
        | render timechart
        ```

    6. Creating Azure Sentinel Workbooks:
        Azure Sentinel workbooks provide a powerful way to build interactive dashboards. You can use the "Workbook" feature in Azure Sentinel to create custom workbooks with multiple visualizations, query parameters, and interactive elements. Workbooks allow you to combine various KQL queries and charts into a single, cohesive dashboard that can be shared with others in your organization.

    7. Time Range and Query Parameters:
        Workbooks can include time range and query parameters to allow users to interactively change the scope of the data displayed. This enables users to adjust the timeframe, apply filters, or input values dynamically, enhancing the dashboard's flexibility.

    By using KQL and Azure Sentinel workbooks, you can transform your raw security data into dynamic and interactive dashboards, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and share critical insights with your security team and stakeholders. The flexibility of KQL and the visualization capabilities of workbooks help you gain a comprehensive understanding of your organization's security posture and enable more informed decision-making.
- Creating Custom Analytics Rules: Learn how to create custom analytics rules in Azure Sentinel using KQL for proactive monitoring and alerting.

    Creating Custom Analytics Rules in Azure Sentinel using KQL:

    Custom analytics rules in Azure Sentinel allow you to define your own logic for detecting specific security threats, unusual activities, or patterns of interest. These rules help you proactively monitor your environment and trigger alerts when suspicious events are detected. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating custom analytics rules using Kusto Query Language (KQL):

    1. **Navigate to Analytics Rules**:
    In the Azure Sentinel portal, go to "Configuration" and select "Analytics" from the left navigation pane. Click on the "Create" button to start creating a new analytics rule.

    2. **Provide Rule Information**:
    Enter a meaningful name and description for the rule to identify its purpose and function.

    3. **Specify Data Source**:
    Choose the data source that the rule will monitor. You can select specific tables, such as SecurityEvent or Heartbeat, or use custom tables created from your data sources.

    4. **Define Rule Logic using KQL**:
    In the "Custom rule query" section, use KQL to write the logic for your custom analytics rule. This is where you define the conditions that indicate a potential threat. For example, to detect multiple failed logon attempts from a single IP address:

        ```sql
        // Custom rule: Multiple Failed Logon Attempts from a Single IP
        SecurityEvent
        | where EventID == 4625 // Failed logon event
        | where AccountType == "User"
        | summarize FailedLogonAttempts = count() by IPAddress
        | where FailedLogonAttempts >= 5 // Threshold for multiple failed logon attempts
        | project IPAddress
        ```

    5. **Set Rule Schedule and Threshold**:
    Configure how often the rule should run (e.g., every 5 minutes, 15 minutes) and set the threshold for triggering an alert (e.g., the number of occurrences required within the specified time frame).

    6. **Define Rule Severity and Tactic**:
    Assign a severity level to the rule based on its impact on security. You can also specify the tactic associated with the rule, such as "Credential Access" or "Malicious Activity," to help categorize and prioritize alerts.

    7. **Enable Rule and Save**:
    Once you've defined the custom rule, toggle the "Enable" switch to activate it. Click on the "Save" button to save the rule configuration.

    8. **Review and Monitor Alerts**:
    After enabling the custom analytics rule, Azure Sentinel will monitor the specified data source for matches to the defined conditions. When a matching event is detected, an alert will be generated. You can review and manage these alerts in the "Incidents" section of Azure Sentinel.

    9. **Tune and Refine Rules**:
    Periodically review the performance and effectiveness of your custom analytics rules. Refine and adjust the rules as needed to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy.

    Custom analytics rules in Azure Sentinel using KQL provide a flexible and powerful way to tailor threat detection to your organization's specific security requirements. By leveraging KQL's capabilities and writing targeted rule logic, you can proactively monitor your environment and promptly respond to potential security threats, enhancing your organization's overall security posture.
- Best Practices and Optimization: Understand best practices for writing efficient and performant KQL queries, as well as tips for optimizing query performance.

Best Practices for Writing Efficient and Performant KQL Queries:

1. **Use Specific Data Source and Columns**:
   Query only the necessary data sources and columns needed for analysis. Avoid using wildcard `*` to retrieve all columns when only a few are required, as it can significantly impact query performance.

2. **Filter Early, Filter Often**:
   Apply filtering (using `where` clause) as early as possible in your query to reduce the amount of data processed. Filtering at the beginning of the query optimizes the query execution by narrowing down the dataset before performing other operations.

3. **Limit Results with `take` and `limit`**:
   Use the `take` operator for small result sets or `limit` for large result sets to limit the number of records returned. This can help avoid excessive data transfer and improve query response times.

4. **Avoid Repetitive Computations**:
   If you need to perform the same computation multiple times, consider using intermediate variables (`let` statement) to store the result and reuse it instead of recomputing the same values.

5. **Use Aggregations Wisely**:
   Aggregations like `summarize`, `count`, and `sum` can be resource-intensive. Use them judiciously and avoid unnecessary aggregation steps in your query.

6. **Limit `join` Operations**:
   Minimize the number of `join` operations in your query, as joins can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.

7. **Be Mindful of Data Type Conversions**:
   Avoid excessive data type conversions in your queries, as they can impact performance. Ensure that your queries use consistent data types wherever possible.

8. **Use `has` Instead of `contains`**:
   If possible, use `has` operator instead of `contains` when working with arrays, as `has` is faster and more efficient.

9. **Optimize Time-Based Filters**:
   For time-based analysis, use the `between` operator when filtering on time ranges to ensure optimal query performance.

10. **Use `project-away` to Remove Unwanted Columns**:
    When you want to remove specific columns from the query result, use the `project-away` operator instead of `project` to exclude unwanted columns, as it is more efficient.

Tips for Optimizing Query Performance:

1. **Review Query Execution Plans**:
   Azure Data Explorer provides query execution plans that can help you understand how your queries are executed. Reviewing the execution plans can identify areas for optimization.

2. **Enable Caching**:
   Take advantage of caching to improve query performance for commonly executed queries. Cached results can be served faster, reducing the need to recompute the same query.

3. **Use Materialized Views**:
   Materialized views can precompute and store results for specific queries, leading to faster query response times for those scenarios.

4. **Indexing**:
   Use appropriate indexing on columns that are frequently used in filters or joins to improve query performance.

5. **Data Retention Policies**:
   Implement data retention policies to remove old data that is no longer needed. This can help reduce the data volume being queried and improve performance.

6. **Use Distribution and Sharding Strategies**:
   In multi-cluster environments, consider using appropriate distribution and sharding strategies to ensure even data distribution and balanced query processing.

7. **Regularly Monitor and Tune**:
   Regularly monitor query performance and identify queries that might need optimization. Tuning queries based on actual usage patterns can significantly improve overall performance.

By following these best practices and optimization techniques, you can write efficient and performant KQL queries in Azure Data Explorer, resulting in quicker query response times and a better overall experience in Azure Sentinel or any other application using Kusto Query Language.

By the end of this 3-day course, you will have a strong foundation in using KQL for querying and analytics in Azure Sentinel. You will be able to write effective queries, analyze security logs, detect threats, and create custom analytics rules to enhance your security monitoring capabilities.
