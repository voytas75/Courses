#### Lesson 2: Basic Syntax

##### Learning about metacharacters and their functions

In this lesson, we‚Äôll dive into the fundamental building blocks of regex: metacharacters. Metacharacters are special characters that have specific functions in defining regex patterns.

üî§ Literal Characters:

- Most characters in a regex pattern are treated as literal characters.
- For example, the pattern `hello` will match the exact sequence ‚Äúhello‚Äù in a text.

Metacharacters:
Metacharacters are characters with special meanings in regex and provide more advanced pattern matching capabilities.

`.` (Dot):

- The dot metacharacter matches any single character, except for a newline character.
- For example, the pattern `a.b` will match ‚Äúaab‚Äù, ‚Äúacb‚Äù, ‚Äúadb‚Äù, etc., but not ‚Äúa\nb‚Äù.

`*` (Asterisk):

- The asterisk metacharacter matches the preceding character zero or more times.
- For example, the pattern `ab*c` will match ‚Äúac‚Äù, ‚Äúabc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbbc‚Äù, etc.

`+` (Plus):

- The plus metacharacter matches the preceding character one or more times.
- For example, the pattern `ab+c` will match ‚Äúabc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbbc‚Äù, etc., but not ‚Äúac‚Äù.

`?` (Question Mark):

- The question mark metacharacter matches the preceding character zero or one time.
- For example, the pattern `colou?r` will match both ‚Äúcolor‚Äù and ‚Äúcolour‚Äù.

`|` (Pipe):

- The pipe metacharacter acts as an OR operator and matches either the pattern before or after it.
- For example, the pattern `apple|orange` will match ‚Äúapple‚Äù or ‚Äúorange‚Äù.

`[]` (Character Class):

- The character class metacharacters allow matching a specific set of characters.
- For example, the pattern `[aeiou]` will match any single vowel character.

`[^]` (Negation in Character Class):

- When ^ is used as the first character within a character class, it negates the set, matching any character not in the class.
- For example, the pattern `[^aeiou]` will match any non-vowel character.

`()` (Grouping):

- Parentheses are used to create groups and capture sub-patterns within a regex expression.
- For example, the pattern `(ab)+` will match ‚Äúab‚Äù, ‚Äúabab‚Äù, ‚Äúababab‚Äù, etc.

These are some of the essential metacharacters in regex, and they provide a solid foundation for constructing more complex patterns to match specific text patterns effectively.

In the next lesson, we will explore how to use the `-match` operator in PowerShell to apply these regex patterns and perform text filtering. üåü

##### Creating simple regex patterns for pattern matching

In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn how to create simple regex patterns to perform pattern matching in PowerShell. We‚Äôll construct regex patterns step by step to match specific text patterns.

üîç Scenario 1: Matching Exact Text
To match exact text, simply use the literal characters.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `hello`
Text to Match: ‚Äúhello‚Äù

üîç Scenario 2: Using the Dot Metacharacter
The dot `.` matches any single character, except for a newline.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `a.b`
Text to Match: ‚Äúaab‚Äù, ‚Äúacb‚Äù, ‚Äúadb‚Äù, etc.

üîç Scenario 3: Using the Asterisk Metacharacter
The asterisk * matches the preceding character zero or more times.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `ab*c`
Text to Match: ‚Äúac‚Äù, ‚Äúabc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbbc‚Äù, etc.

üîç Scenario 4: Using the Plus Metacharacter
The plus + matches the preceding character one or more times.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `ab+c`
Text to Match: ‚Äúabc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbc‚Äù, ‚Äúabbbc‚Äù, etc.

üîç Scenario 5: Using the Question Mark Metacharacter
The question mark ? matches the preceding character zero or one time.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `colou?r`
Text to Match: ‚Äúcolor‚Äù, ‚Äúcolour‚Äù

üîç Scenario 6: Using the Pipe Metacharacter
The pipe | acts as an OR operator and matches either the pattern before or after it.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `apple|orange`
Text to Match: ‚Äúapple‚Äù or ‚Äúorange‚Äù

üîç Scenario 7: Using Character Classes
Character classes allow matching a specific set of characters.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `[aeiou]`
Text to Match: Any single vowel character

üîç Scenario 8: Using Negation in Character Class
The ^ within a character class negates the set, matching any character not in the class.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `[^aeiou]`
Text to Match: Any non-vowel character

üîç Scenario 9: Using Grouping
Parentheses () are used to create groups and capture sub-patterns within a regex expression.

Example:
Regex Pattern: `(ab)+`
Text to Match: ‚Äúab‚Äù, ‚Äúabab‚Äù, ‚Äúababab‚Äù, etc.

By combining these simple regex patterns, you can create powerful expressions to match specific text patterns in your PowerShell scripts. As you practice and gain confidence, you‚Äôll be able to create more complex regex patterns for diverse use cases.

In the next lesson, we‚Äôll explore how to use the -match operator in PowerShell to apply these regex patterns for text filtering. üåü

#### Lesson 3: Using `-match`

##### Practical examples of using the `-match` operator

In this lesson, we‚Äôll explore how to use the -match operator in PowerShell with practical examples to apply regex patterns for text filtering.

üîç Scenario 1: Basic Pattern Matching
Suppose we have a list of names, and we want to filter out names that start with the letter ‚ÄúA.‚Äù

Example:

```powershell
# Sample list of names
$names = "Alice", "Bob", "Anna", "Alex", "David"

# Filter names starting with "A" using -match
$filteredNames = $names -match '^A'

# Output the filtered names
$filteredNames
```

üîç Scenario 2: Extracting Email Addresses
Assume we have a text containing email addresses, and we want to extract all valid email addresses from it.

Example:

```powershell
# Sample text containing email addresses
$text = "Contact us at info@example.com or support@domain.com for assistance."

# Extract email addresses using -match
$emails = $text -match '\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b'

# Output the extracted email addresses
$emails
```

üîç Scenario 3: Extracting URLs
Suppose we have a webpage‚Äôs HTML content, and we want to extract all URLs from it.

Example:

```powershell
# Sample HTML content
$html = @"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    <a href="https://domain.com">Visit Domain</a>
    <a href="https://test.com">Visit Test</a>
</body>
</html>
"@

# Extract URLs using -match
$urls = $html -match 'https?://[^\s<>"]+'

# Output the extracted URLs
$urls
```

üîç Scenario 4: Replacing Patterns
We have a string containing phone numbers in different formats, and we want to standardize them.

Example:

```powershell
# Sample text containing phone numbers
$phones = "Call us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance."

# Replace phone numbers with a standardized format using -replace
$standardizedPhones = $phones -replace '\b\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b', 'XXX-XXX-XXXX'

# Output the text with standardized phone numbers
$standardizedPhones
```

üí° Important Note:
Ensure you thoroughly test your regex patterns to avoid unintended matches and ensure they match the desired patterns accurately.

The -match operator allows you to efficiently filter and process data using regex patterns within PowerShell. By combining regex with PowerShell‚Äôs capabilities, you can perform powerful text filtering, data extraction, and data manipulation tasks.

In the next lesson, we‚Äôll explore more advanced regex concepts, including character classes, grouping, and backreferences. üåü

##### Hands-on exercises for text filtering

Let's dive into some hands-on exercises for text filtering using the `-match` operator with regex patterns in PowerShell.

üîç **Exercise 1: Filtering Names**
Given a list of names, filter out the names that contain the letter "o" anywhere in the name.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample list of names
$names = "John", "Alice", "Robert", "Tom", "Olivia", "Samantha"

# Filter names containing "o" using -match
$filteredNames = $names -match 'o'

# Output the filtered names
$filteredNames
```

üîç **Exercise 2: Extracting Dates**
Extract all the dates in the format "dd/mm/yyyy" from the given text.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing dates
$text = "This text contains some dates like 12/07/2023, 25/09/2023, and 31/12/2023."

# Extract dates using -match
$dates = $text -match '\b\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}\b'

# Output the extracted dates
$dates
```

üîç **Exercise 3: Extracting Hashtags**
Extract all the hashtags from the given tweet.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample tweet containing hashtags
$tweet = "Excited to announce our new product launch #TechGuru #Innovation"

# Extract hashtags using -match
$hashtags = $tweet -match '#\w+'

# Output the extracted hashtags
$hashtags
```

üîç **Exercise 4: Filtering Domain Names**
Filter out the email addresses from the given list that belong to the domain "example.com".

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample list of email addresses
$emails = "john@example.com", "alice@domain.com", "robert@example.com", "samantha@domain.com"

# Filter emails from the domain "example.com" using -match
$filteredEmails = $emails -match '@example\.com'

# Output the filtered email addresses
$filteredEmails
```

üí° **Tips:**

- In each exercise, we used the `-match` operator with an appropriate regex pattern to perform text filtering or extraction.
- Ensure you understand the regex pattern used in each example to match the desired text pattern accurately.

These hands-on exercises will help you practice text filtering using regex patterns and the `-match` operator in PowerShell. As you become more comfortable with regex, you'll be able to apply it to various real-world scenarios to efficiently process and manipulate text data.

### Module 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers

- Working with character classes (e.g., `\d`, `\w`, `\s`, etc.)

In this lesson, we'll explore character classes in regex, which allow you to match specific sets of characters. Character classes are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` and provide a concise way to represent groups of characters.

üî§ **Matching Digits - `\d`:**
The `\d` character class matches any digit (0-9).

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing digits
$text = "There are 3 apples and 5 oranges."

# Match digits using \d
$matchedDigits = $text -match '\d'

# Output the matched digits
$matchedDigits
```

üî§ **Matching Word Characters - `\w`:**
The `\w` character class matches any word character (alphanumeric characters and underscores).

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing word characters
$text = "Hello, this is a_sample_text123."

# Match word characters using \w
$matchedWordCharacters = $text -match '\w+'

# Output the matched word characters
$matchedWordCharacters
```

üî§ **Matching Whitespace - `\s`:**
The `\s` character class matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing whitespace
$text = "Hello,    how are you?"

# Match whitespace characters using \s
$matchedWhitespace = $text -match '\s+'

# Output the matched whitespace characters
$matchedWhitespace
```

üî§ **Negating Character Classes - `[^ ]`:**
When `^` is used as the first character within a character class, it negates the set, matching any character not in the class.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing characters not in the set
$text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Match characters not in the set using [^ ]
$matchedNonAlphabetic = $text -match '[^A-Za-z ]+'

# Output the matched characters not in the set
$matchedNonAlphabetic
```

Character classes provide a powerful way to match specific groups of characters, making text processing and filtering more efficient. You can combine character classes with other regex concepts like quantifiers and grouping to create complex patterns for your specific needs.

In the next lesson, we'll explore quantifiers in regex, which allow you to define the number of occurrences of characters or groups. üåü

- Utilizing quantifiers (e.g., `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}`) for repetition.

In this lesson, we'll explore quantifiers in regex, which allow you to define the number of occurrences of characters or groups. Quantifiers provide a concise way to repeat patterns, making regex patterns more flexible and powerful.

üî¢ **`*` (Asterisk - Zero or More):**
The asterisk `*` matches the preceding character or group zero or more times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Heyyyy, how are you?"

# Match repeated characters using *
$matchedAsterisk = $text -match 'y*'

# Output the matched characters with zero or more "y"s
$matchedAsterisk
```

Output:

```text
H
eyyyy
```

üî¢ **`+` (Plus - One or More):**
The plus `+` matches the preceding character or group one or more times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Hello, this is a greatttt day!"

# Match repeated characters using +
$matchedPlus = $text -match 't+'

# Output the matched characters with one or more "t"s
$matchedPlus
```

Output:

```text
tttt
```

üî¢ **`?` (Question Mark - Zero or One):**
The question mark `?` matches the preceding character or group zero or one time.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing optional characters
$text = "Colors: color or colour?"

# Match optional characters using ?
$matchedQuestionMark = $text -match 'colou?r'

# Output the matched variations of "color" and "colour"
$matchedQuestionMark
```

Output:

```text
color
colour
```

üî¢ **`{n}` (Exact Repetition):**
The `{n}` quantifier matches the preceding character or group exactly `n` times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Wow, sooo many o's in this word!"

# Match repeated characters using {n}
$matchedExactRepetition = $text -match 'o{3}'

# Output the matched characters with exactly three "o"s
$matchedExactRepetition
```

Output:

```text
ooo
```

üî¢ **`{n,}` (At Least n Repetitions):**
The `{n,}` quantifier matches the preceding character or group at least `n` times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Yessss, we did ittttt!"

# Match characters repeated at least three times using {n,}
$matchedAtLeastThree = $text -match 's{3,}'

# Output the matched characters repeated at least three times
$matchedAtLeastThree
```

Output:

```text
ssss
```

üî¢ **`{n,m}` (Between n and m Repetitions):**
The `{n,m}` quantifier matches the preceding character or group between `n` and `m` times (inclusive).

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Let's meet at 12:30, 15:45, and 18:00."

# Match time formats using {n,m}
$matchedTimeFormats = $text -match '\d{1,2}:\d{2}'

# Output the matched time formats in "hh:mm" pattern
$matchedTimeFormats
```

Output:

```text
12:30
15:45
18:00
```

Using quantifiers allows you to specify the number of occurrences of characters or groups in a regex pattern. It gives you precise control over repetition, making regex patterns more flexible and efficient.

In the next lesson, we'll explore grouping in regex, which allows you to apply quantifiers to multiple characters or groups as a unit. üåü

#### Lesson 1: Character Classes

##### Understanding common character classes and their meanings

Understanding common character classes is essential in regex as they provide a convenient way to match specific sets of characters. Here are some of the most commonly used character classes and their meanings:

üî§ **`\d`:**

- `\d` matches any digit character (0-9).

üí° **Example:**
`"Hello 123 World!"` -> Matches `1`, `2`, `3`.

üî§ **`\D`:**

- `\D` matches any non-digit character (any character that is not a digit).

üí° **Example:**
`"Hello 123 World!"` -> Matches all characters except `1`, `2`, `3`.

üî§ **`\w`:**

- `\w` matches any word character (alphanumeric characters and underscores).

üí° **Example:**
`"Hello_World_123"` -> Matches all alphanumeric characters and underscores.

üî§ **`\W`:**

- `\W` matches any non-word character (any character that is not an alphanumeric character or underscore).

üí° **Example:**
`"Hello_World_123"` -> Matches all characters except alphanumeric characters and underscores.

üî§ **`\s`:**

- `\s` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).

üí° **Example:**
`"Hello, how are you?"` -> Matches the space character between each word.

üî§ **`\S`:**

- `\S` matches any non-whitespace character (any character that is not a whitespace character).

üí° **Example:**
`"Hello, how are you?"` -> Matches all characters except whitespace.

üî§ **`[ ]`: Character Class:**

- `[ ]` allows matching any character present within the square brackets.

üí° **Example:**
`"cat dog bat"` -> Matches `"cat"`, `"dog"`, `"bat"` individually.

üî§ **`[^ ]`: Negation in Character Class:**

- `[^ ]` allows matching any character not present within the square brackets.

üí° **Example:**
`"cat dog bat"` -> Matches all characters except `"c"`, `"a"`, `"t"`, `"d"`, `"o"`, `"g"`, `"b"`.

These character classes provide a powerful and flexible way to define patterns for matching specific groups of characters or excluding certain characters from matches. They are often combined with other regex concepts like quantifiers and grouping to create complex patterns for various text processing tasks.

Understanding these common character classes will significantly enhance your ability to work with regex patterns effectively. üåü

##### Applying character classes to filter data

Let's apply character classes to filter data using the `-match` operator in PowerShell with practical examples.

üîç **Example 1: Filtering Digits**
Filter out only the lines containing digits from the given text.

**Input Text:**

```text
This is a sample text.
Line 2 contains numbers.
No digits here.
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Input text
$text = @"
This is a sample text.
Line 2 contains numbers.
No digits here.
"@

# Filter lines containing digits using \d
$filteredLines = $text -split '\r?\n' | Where-Object { $_ -match '\d' }

# Output the filtered lines
$filteredLines
```

**Output:**

```text
Line 2 contains numbers.
```

üîç **Example 2: Filtering URLs**
Extract all the URLs from the given HTML content.

**Input Text:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    <a href="https://domain.com">Visit Domain</a>
    <a href="https://test.com">Visit Test</a>
</body>
</html>
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Input HTML content
$html = @"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    <a href="https://domain.com">Visit Domain</a>
    <a href="https://test.com">Visit Test</a>
</body>
</html>
"@

# Extract URLs using regex with character class [^\s<>"]+
$urls = $html -match 'https?://[^\s<>"]+'

# Output the extracted URLs
$urls
```

**Output:**

```text
https://example.com
https://domain.com
https://test.com
```

üîç **Example 3: Filtering Phone Numbers**
Filter out phone numbers in the format "XXX-XXX-XXXX" from the given text.

**Input Text:**

```text
Contact us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance.
No phone numbers here.
Another number: 555-1234.
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Input text
$text = @"
Contact us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance.
No phone numbers here.
Another number: 555-1234.
"@

# Filter phone numbers using \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
$filteredNumbers = $text -split '\r?\n' | Where-Object { $_ -match '\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}' }

# Output the filtered phone numbers
$filteredNumbers
```

**Output:**

```text
Contact us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance.
Another number: 555-1234.
```

In each example, we utilized character classes within the `-match` operator's regex pattern to filter specific data from the input text. Character classes, combined with other regex concepts, allow you to precisely extract or filter data based on specific patterns, making your text processing tasks more efficient and accurate.

Feel free to experiment with different patterns and character classes to suit your specific filtering needs! üåü

#### Lesson 2: Quantifiers in Action

##### Exploring different quantifiers and their effects on matching

In this lesson, we'll explore different quantifiers in regex and observe their effects on matching patterns. Quantifiers allow us to define the number of occurrences of characters or groups, giving us the flexibility to match varying repetitions.

üî¢ **`*` (Asterisk - Zero or More):**
The asterisk `*` matches the preceding character or group zero or more times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Heyyyy, how are you?"

# Match repeated characters using *
$matchedAsterisk = $text -match 'y*'

# Output the matched characters with zero or more "y"s
$matchedAsterisk
```

Output:

```text
yyy
```

üî¢ **`+` (Plus - One or More):**
The plus `+` matches the preceding character or group one or more times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Hello, this is a greatttt day!"

# Match repeated characters using +
$matchedPlus = $text -match 't+'

# Output the matched characters with one or more "t"s
$matchedPlus
```

Output:

```text
tttt
```

üî¢ **`?` (Question Mark - Zero or One):**
The question mark `?` matches the preceding character or group zero or one time.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing optional characters
$text = "Colors: color or colour?"

# Match optional characters using ?
$matchedQuestionMark = $text -match 'colou?r'

# Output the matched variations of "color" and "colour"
$matchedQuestionMark
```

Output:

```text
color
colour
```

üî¢ **`{n}` (Exact Repetition):**
The `{n}` quantifier matches the preceding character or group exactly `n` times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Wow, sooo many o's in this word!"

# Match repeated characters using {n}
$matchedExactRepetition = $text -match 'o{3}'

# Output the matched characters with exactly three "o"s
$matchedExactRepetition
```

Output:

```text
ooo
```

üî¢ **`{n,}` (At Least n Repetitions):**
The `{n,}` quantifier matches the preceding character or group at least `n` times.

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Yessss, we did ittttt!"

# Match characters repeated at least three times using {n,}
$matchedAtLeastThree = $text -match 's{3,}'

# Output the matched characters repeated at least three times
$matchedAtLeastThree
```

Output:

```text
ssss
sssss
```

üî¢ **`{n,m}` (Between n and m Repetitions):**
The `{n,m}` quantifier matches the preceding character or group between `n` and `m` times (inclusive).

**Example:**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Let's meet at 12:30, 15:45, and 18:00."

# Match time formats using {n,m}
$matchedTimeFormats = $text -match '\d{1,2}:\d{2}'

# Output the matched time formats in "hh:mm" pattern
$matchedTimeFormats
```

Output:

```text
12:30
15:45
18:00
```

Quantifiers play a vital role in creating flexible regex patterns to match varying repetitions of characters or groups. By understanding and utilizing these quantifiers effectively, you can craft precise regex patterns for various text processing tasks.üåü

##### Practice exercises to reinforce learning

Here are some practice exercises to reinforce your learning of character classes and quantifiers in regex:

üîç **Exercise 1: Matching Phone Numbers**

Excited to announce our new product launch #TechGuru #Innovation
```

Feel free to try out these exercises and apply the concepts of character classes and quantifiers in regex to solve them. You can use PowerShell with the `-match` operator to perform the regex matching.

Regex practice will enhance your understanding and proficiency in text processing using character classes and quantifiers. Happy practicing! üåü

### Module 3: Grouping and Capturing

- Grouping patterns with parentheses and capturing matches.

In this module, we'll explore how to group patterns using parentheses in regex and capture the matched content. Grouping allows us to apply quantifiers and other regex operators to multiple characters or groups as a unit.

üîç **Grouping with Parentheses - `( )`:**
Parentheses `( )` are used to create groups in regex. Everything enclosed within the parentheses is treated as a single unit. This allows us to apply quantifiers or other operators to the entire group.

üí° **Example 1: Matching Repeated Characters**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Wow, sooo many o's in this word!"

# Match repeated characters using ( )
$matchedGroup = $text -match 'o{3}'

# Output the matched characters with exactly three "o"s
$matchedGroup
```

Output:

```text
ooo
```

üí° **Example 2: Extracting Phone Numbers**

```powershell
# Sample text containing phone numbers
$text = "Call us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance."

# Extract phone numbers using ( )
$phoneNumbers = $text -match '(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})'

# Output the extracted phone numbers
$phoneNumbers
```

Output:

```text
123-456-7890
```

üí° **Example 3: Extracting Dates**

```powershell
# Sample text containing dates in the format "dd-mm-yyyy"
$text = "Today is 25-07-2023. Tomorrow will be 26-07-2023. Don't forget the event on 30-07-2023."

# Extract dates using ( )
$dates = $text -match '(\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4})'

# Output the extracted dates
$dates
```

Output:

```text
25-07-2023
26-07-2023
30-07-2023
```

üîç **Capturing Matches:**
When we use groups `( )`, we can capture the matched content within the parentheses for further use. The captured content can be accessed using the `$Matches` automatic variable in PowerShell.

üí° **Example: Capturing Phone Numbers**

```powershell
# Sample text containing phone numbers
$text = "Call us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance."

# Extract phone numbers using ( ) and capture matches
$text -match '(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})'
$matchedPhoneNumber = $Matches[1]

# Output the captured phone number
$matchedPhoneNumber
```

Output:

```text
123-456-7890
```

In this example, we used parentheses to group the regex pattern for the phone number. We then captured the matched phone number using `$Matches[1]`.

Grouping with parentheses and capturing matches are powerful concepts in regex. They allow us to create complex patterns and extract specific parts of the matched content for further processing.üåü

- Using backreferences to refer to captured groups.

In regex, backreferences allow us to refer back to the content captured by groups `( )`. We use backreferences to match the same content that was previously captured by a group. Backreferences are denoted by the backslash `\` followed by the group number.

üí° **Example 1: Matching Repeated Words**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated words
$text = "Let's meet meet at the park."

# Match repeated words using backreferences
$matchedRepeatedWords = $text -match '\b(\w+)\s+\1\b'

# Output the matched repeated words
$matchedRepeatedWords
```

Output:

```text
meet meet
```

In this example, the regex pattern `\b(\w+)\s+\1\b` captures a word and then matches the same word again using `\1`, which is the backreference to the first captured group.

The pattern breakdown:

- `\b` matches a word boundary to ensure we capture whole words.
- `(\w+)` is the first capturing group that matches one or more word characters.
- `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters between the repeated words.
- `\1` is the backreference to the first captured group, which matches the same content as the first group.

üí° **Example 2: Extracting HTML Tags**

```powershell
# Sample HTML content
$html = @"
<p>Hello, <b>world!</b></p>
<p>This is <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>.</p>
"@

# Extract HTML tags using backreferences
$tags = $html -match '<(\w+)>(.*?)<\/\1>'

# Output the extracted HTML tags
$tags
```

Output:

```text
<p>Hello, <b>world!</b></p>
<i>italic</i>
<b>bold</b>
```

In this example, the regex pattern `<(\w+)>(.*?)<\/\1>` captures and matches HTML tags. Let's break down the pattern:

- `<(\w+)>` captures the opening HTML tag and the `\w+` matches the tag name.
- `(.*?)` captures the content between the opening and closing tags non-greedily.
- `<\/\1>` is the backreference `\1`, which matches the closing tag corresponding to the captured opening tag.

Backreferences are a powerful feature in regex that enables us to create more complex patterns by reusing previously captured content. They are particularly useful when working with repetitive patterns, such as repeated words or matching paired elements like HTML tags.

#### Lesson 1: Grouping Patterns

##### Creating and using groups for advanced pattern matching

In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into creating and using groups in regex for advanced pattern matching. Groups allow us to treat multiple characters or sub-patterns as a single unit, which enables us to apply quantifiers and other operators to that unit.

üîç **Grouping with Parentheses - `( )`:**
Parentheses `( )` are used to create groups in regex. Everything enclosed within the parentheses is treated as a single unit.

üí° **Example 1: Matching Repeated Characters**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated characters
$text = "Wow, sooo many o's in this word!"

# Match repeated characters using ( )
$matchedGroup = $text -match 'o{3}'

# Output the matched characters with exactly three "o"s
$matchedGroup
```

Output:

```text
ooo
```

üí° **Example 2: Extracting Phone Numbers**

```powershell
# Sample text containing phone numbers
$text = "Call us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance."

# Extract phone numbers using ( )
$phoneNumbers = $text -match '(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})'

# Output the extracted phone numbers
$phoneNumbers
```

Output:

```text
123-456-7890
```

üîç **Capturing Matches:**
When we use groups `( )`, we can capture the matched content within the parentheses for further use. The captured content can be accessed using the `$Matches` automatic variable in PowerShell.

üí° **Example: Capturing Phone Numbers**

```powershell
# Sample text containing phone numbers
$text = "Call us at 123-456-7890 or 9876543210 for assistance."

# Extract phone numbers using ( ) and capture matches
$text -match '(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})'
$matchedPhoneNumber = $Matches[1]

# Output the captured phone number
$matchedPhoneNumber
```

Output:

```text
123-456-7890
```

üîç **Using Backreferences - `\1`, `\2`, etc.:**
Backreferences allow us to refer back to the content captured by groups. We use backslashes `\` followed by the group number to create backreferences.

üí° **Example: Matching Repeated Words**

```powershell
# Sample text containing repeated words
$text = "Let's meet meet at the park."

# Match repeated words using backreferences
$matchedRepeatedWords = $text -match '\b(\w+)\s+\1\b'

# Output the matched repeated words
$matchedRepeatedWords
```

Output:

```text
meet meet
```

Groups and backreferences provide powerful tools for crafting complex regex patterns and efficiently extracting specific content from text data. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to perform advanced pattern matching for various text processing tasks.

##### Working with multiple groups in a single expression

In regex, you can work with multiple groups within a single expression to capture and manipulate different parts of the matched content. Each group is denoted by parentheses `( )` and is assigned a group number starting from 1. You can access the content captured by each group using backreferences `\1`, `\2`, and so on.

üí° **Example 1: Extracting Date Components**

```powershell
# Sample text containing dates in the format "dd-mm-yyyy"
$text = "Today is 25-07-2023. Tomorrow will be 26-07-2023."

# Extract day, month, and year components using multiple groups
$text -match '(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})'
$day = $Matches[1]
$month = $Matches[2]
$year = $Matches[3]

# Output the extracted components
"Day: $day, Month: $month, Year: $year"
```

Output:

```text
Day: 25, Month: 07, Year: 2023
```

In this example, we used three groups `(\d{2})`, `(\d{2})`, and `(\d{4})` to capture the day, month, and year components of the date. We then accessed the captured values using `$Matches[1]`, `$Matches[2]`, and `$Matches[3]` respectively.

üí° **Example 2: Formatting Phone Numbers**

```powershell
# Sample text containing phone numbers in different formats
$text = "Call us at 123-456-7890 or (987)654-3210 for assistance."

# Format phone numbers using multiple groups and backreferences
$formattedText = $text -replace '(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})', '($1)$2-$3'

# Output the formatted text
$formattedText
```

Output:

```text
Call us at (123)456-7890 or (987)654-3210 for assistance.
```

In this example, we used three groups `(\d{3})`, `(\d{3})`, and `(\d{4})` to capture the three parts of the phone numbers. We then used backreferences `$1`, `$2`, and `$3` to refer to the captured groups and format the phone numbers accordingly.

Working with multiple groups allows you to perform more complex manipulations on the matched content and extract specific parts of the data for further processing.

#### Lesson 2: Capturing Matches

##### Understanding how to capture specific portions of a match

In this lesson, we'll focus on understanding how to capture specific portions of a match using groups in regex. By creating groups with parentheses `()`, we can isolate and extract particular parts of the matched content for further processing.

üîç **Capturing Matches with Groups - `( )`:**
Groups in regex are created using parentheses `( )`. These groups allow us to capture specific portions of a match and save them for later use or extraction.

üí° **Example 1: Extracting URLs and their Protocols**

```powershell
# Sample text containing URLs
$text = "Visit our website at https://www.example.com and check our blog at http://blog.example.com"

# Extract URLs and their protocols using groups
$urls = $text -match '(https?://\S+)'

# Output the captured URLs
$urls
```

Output:

```text
https://www.example.com
http://blog.example.com
```

In this example, we used a group `(https?://\S+)` to capture URLs and their protocols. The `https?` matches both "http" and "https", and `\S+` matches any non-whitespace characters after the protocol.

üí° **Example 2: Extracting Names and Email Addresses**

```powershell
# Sample text containing names and email addresses
$text = "Contact John Doe at john.doe@example.com or Jane Smith at jane.smith@example.com"

# Extract names and email addresses using groups
$text -match '(\w+\s\w+)\s+at\s+(\S+@\S+)'
$names = $Matches[1]
$emailAddresses = $Matches[2]

# Output the captured names and email addresses
$names
$emailAddresses
```

Output:

```text
John Doe
john.doe@example.com
Jane Smith
jane.smith@example.com
```

In this example, we used two groups `(\w+\s\w+)` and `(\S+@\S+)` to capture names and email addresses respectively. `\w+\s\w+` matches a first name followed by a space and a last name. `\S+@\S+` matches an email address.

By using groups, you can selectively capture and save specific portions of the matched content, making it easier to handle and manipulate data during text processing tasks.

##### Hands-on examples for practical understanding

Let's dive into some hands-on examples to gain practical understanding of using groups in regex for capturing matches:

üîç **Example 1: Extracting File Extensions**
Given a list of file names, extract only the file extensions.

**Sample Input:**

```text
resume.docx
presentation.ppt
document.pdf
script.js
image.png
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Input file names
$fileNames = @"
resume.docx
presentation.ppt
document.pdf
script.js
image.png
"@

# Extract file extensions using group (\.\w+)
$fileExtensions = $fileNames -match '(\.\w+)'

# Output the extracted file extensions
$fileExtensions
```

**Output:**

```text
.docx
.ppt
.pdf
.js
.png
```

üîç **Example 2: Extracting Time from Log**
Given a log containing timestamps, extract the time (hh:mm:ss) from each log entry.

**Sample Input:**

```text
[2023-07-25 09:30:15] Task started.
[2023-07-25 10:15:02] Task completed successfully.
[2023-07-25 12:45:00] Error: Task failed.
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Input log entries
$logEntries = @"
[2023-07-25 09:30:15] Task started.
[2023-07-25 10:15:02] Task completed successfully.
[2023-07-25 12:45:00] Error: Task failed.
"@

# Extract time (hh:mm:ss) using group (\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})
$times = $logEntries -match '(\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})'

# Output the extracted times
$times
```

**Output:**

```text
09:30:15
10:15:02
12:45:00
```

In both examples, we used parentheses `(\.\w+)` and `(\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})` to create groups in the regex patterns. These groups captured specific parts of the matched content, i.e., the file extensions and the time, respectively. By accessing the captured content with `$Matches[1]`, we extracted the desired information.

Practicing these examples will help you gain a practical understanding of how to use groups to capture specific portions of the matched content, allowing you to perform more advanced and targeted text processing tasks.

Feel free to try more examples and explore different scenarios to solidify your understanding of working with groups in regex! üåü

### Module 4: PowerShell's Regex Methods

- Exploring additional regex methods in PowerShell (e.g., `Select-String`, `Get-Content -Pattern`, etc.).
- Applying regex in real-world scenarios for text processing.

#### Lesson 1: Select-String Cmdlet

##### Using the `Select-String` cmdlet for searching files and text

In this lesson, we'll explore the `Select-String` cmdlet, which is a powerful PowerShell cmdlet used for searching files and text content using regex patterns. It allows you to efficiently search for patterns in files and retrieve matching lines or the matched content.

üîç **`Select-String` Cmdlet Overview:**
The `Select-String` cmdlet is designed for pattern-based searching in text files. It uses regex patterns to search for matches in files or text content provided as input.

üí° **Example 1: Searching in a Text File**

```powershell
# Search for the word "apple" in a text file
Select-String -Path "C:\Files\fruits.txt" -Pattern "apple"
```

In this example, we used the `Select-String` cmdlet to search for the word "apple" in the file "fruits.txt" located at the specified path. The cmdlet will return any lines containing the word "apple" in the file.

üí° **Example 2: Searching in Multiple Files**

```powershell
# Search for the word "error" in all .log files in a directory
Select-String -Path "C:\Logs\*.log" -Pattern "error"
```

In this example, we used the `Select-String` cmdlet to search for the word "error" in all files with the .log extension within the "C:\Logs" directory. The cmdlet will search all matching log files and return lines containing the word "error".

üí° **Example 3: Case-Insensitive Search**

```powershell
# Search for the word "Hello" case-insensitively in a text file
Select-String -Path "C:\Files\greetings.txt" -Pattern "Hello" -CaseSensitive $false
```

In this example, we used the `-CaseSensitive $false` parameter to perform a case-insensitive search for the word "Hello" in the file "greetings.txt". The cmdlet will match "Hello", "hello", "HELLO", and so on.

üí° **Example 4: Extracting Matching Content**

```powershell
# Extract email addresses from a text file and save them to a new file
$matchingEmails = Select-String -Path "C:\Files\contacts.txt" -Pattern "\S+@\S+" | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value }
$matchingEmails | Out-File "C:\Files\matched_emails.txt"
```

In this example, we used the `Select-String` cmdlet to search for email addresses in the file "contacts.txt". The `-Pattern "\S+@\S+"` pattern captures email addresses. We then used `ForEach-Object` to extract the matched content from each match. Finally, we saved the extracted email addresses to a new file named "matched_emails.txt".

The `Select-String` cmdlet is a versatile tool for searching files and text content based on regex patterns. It allows you to quickly find matches and extract relevant information from files without the need for complex scripts. üåü

##### Practical exercises to search and extract data

Let's delve into some practical exercises that involve using the `Select-String` cmdlet to search and extract data from text files:

üîç **Exercise 1: Searching for IP Addresses**
Given a log file containing various IP addresses, extract all unique IP addresses.

**Sample Input - log.txt:**

```text
[2023-07-25 09:30:15] Access from IP: 192.168.1.100
[2023-07-25 10:15:02] Access from IP: 10.0.0.1
[2023-07-25 12:45:00] Access from IP: 192.168.1.101
[2023-07-25 13:20:30] Access from IP: 192.168.1.100
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Search and extract unique IP addresses from the log file
$logFile = "C:\Logs\log.txt"
$ipAddresses = Select-String -Path $logFile -Pattern '\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}' -AllMatches | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value } | Select-Object -Unique

# Output the unique IP addresses
$ipAddresses
```

**Output:**

```text
192.168.1.100
10.0.0.1
192.168.1.101
```

üîç **Exercise 2: Extracting URLs**
Given a text file with various URLs, extract and save all URLs starting with "https://" to a new file.

**Sample Input - urls.txt:**

```text
Visit our website at https://www.example.com
Check our blog at http://blog.example.com
Secure login at https://secure.example.com/login
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Search and extract URLs starting with "https://" from the file
$inputFile = "C:\Data\urls.txt"
$outputFile = "C:\Data\https_urls.txt"

These practical exercises demonstrate how to use the `Select-String` cmdlet to search and extract data from text files. You can modify the regex patterns to match specific patterns in your data and use the `Select-Object` cmdlet to filter and select specific results.

Feel free to try more exercises and experiment with different scenarios to enhance your understanding of using `Select-String` for data extraction in PowerShell! üåü

#### Lesson 2: `Get-Content -Pattern`

##### Applying regex with the `Get-Content` cmdlet for filtering data

In this lesson, we'll explore how to apply regex with the `Get-Content` cmdlet for filtering data in text files. The `Get-Content` cmdlet reads the content of a file and allows us to use regex patterns to filter and extract specific lines or data that match the pattern.

üîç **`Get-Content` Cmdlet Overview:**
The `Get-Content` cmdlet is used to read the content of a file and return it as an array of strings. By combining it with regex patterns, we can efficiently filter data based on specific matching criteria.

üí° **Example 1: Filtering Lines with Specific Words**

```powershell
# Get lines from a text file containing either "error" or "warning"
Get-Content -Path "C:\Logs\log.txt" | Select-String -Pattern "error|warning"
```

In this example, we used `Get-Content` to read the content of the file "log.txt". The output is then piped to `Select-String`, where the pattern `error|warning` is applied to filter lines containing either "error" or "warning".

üí° **Example 2: Extracting Lines Matching a Specific Pattern**

```powershell
# Get lines from a text file containing IP addresses
Get-Content -Path "C:\Logs\access.log" | Select-String -Pattern "\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"
```

In this example, we used `Get-Content` to read the content of the file "access.log". The pattern "\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}" is used in `Select-String` to filter and extract lines containing IP addresses.

üí° **Example 3: Counting Matching Lines**

```powershell
# Count the number of lines in a text file containing the word "success"
(Get-Content -Path "C:\Logs\status.log" | Select-String -Pattern "success").Count
```

In this example, we used `Get-Content` to read the content of the file "status.log". We then applied the pattern "success" using `Select-String` to filter lines containing the word "success". The `.Count` property is used to get the total count of matching lines.

Applying regex with the `Get-Content` cmdlet allows us to efficiently filter data and extract specific information from text files. It is a powerful approach to process and analyze large volumes of text-based data. üåü

##### Real-world examples and hands-on tasks

Let's explore some real-world examples and hands-on tasks that involve using regex with the `Get-Content` cmdlet to perform text processing and filtering tasks.

üîç **Real-World Example 1: Extracting URLs from Web Server Logs**
Suppose you have a web server log file that contains various log entries. Extract all unique URLs visited by clients.

**Sample Input - access.log:**

```text
[2023-07-25 09:30:15] Client 192.168.1.100 visited /home
[2023-07-25 10:15:02] Client 10.0.0.1 visited /about-us
[2023-07-25 12:45:00] Client 192.168.1.101 visited /products
[2023-07-25 13:20:30] Client 192.168.1.100 visited /home
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Extract unique URLs from the web server log file
$logFile = "C:\Logs\access.log"
$urls = Get-Content -Path $logFile | `
    Select-String -Pattern 'visited (\S+)' | `
    ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value } | `
    Select-Object -Unique

# Output the unique URLs
$urls
```

**Output:**

```text
/home
/about-us
/products
```

üîç **Real-World Example 2: Filtering Apache Configuration**
Suppose you have an Apache web server configuration file, and you want to extract all lines containing virtual host configurations.

**Sample Input - httpd.conf:**

```text
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName test.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/test
</VirtualHost>

# Some comments in the configuration file
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Extract virtual host configurations from the Apache configuration file
$configFile = "C:\Apache\httpd.conf"
$virtualHosts = Get-Content -Path $configFile | Select-String -Pattern '<VirtualHost.*>' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line }

# Output the virtual host configurations
$virtualHosts
```

**Output:**

```text
<VirtualHost *:80>
<VirtualHost *:80>
```

üîç **Hands-On Task: Extracting Phone Numbers**
Given a text file containing various phone numbers in different formats, extract and output all phone numbers in the format "XXX-XXX-XXXX".

**Sample Input - contacts.txt:**

```text
Contact us at 123-456-7890 for assistance.
Call John at (555) 123-4567 to get more information.
Call support on 9876543210.
```

**PowerShell Code:**

```powershell
# Extract phone numbers in the format "XXX-XXX-XXXX" from the text file
$inputFile = "C:\Data\contacts.txt"

$phoneNumbers = Get-Content -Path $inputFile | `
    Select-String -Pattern '\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}' | `
    ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value }

# Output the extracted phone numbers
$phoneNumbers
```

**Output:**

```text
123-456-7890
555-123-4567
```

These real-world examples and hands-on task demonstrate how to apply regex with the `Get-Content` cmdlet for various text processing and filtering scenarios. You can adapt these examples to suit your specific use cases and explore more complex patterns and tasks using PowerShell and regex.

Feel free to experiment with different text files and patterns to solidify your understanding and proficiency in using regex with the `Get-Content` cmdlet! üåü
