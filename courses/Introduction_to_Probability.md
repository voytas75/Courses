## Detailed Course Plan

### Module 1: Introduction to Probability

📚 Lesson 1: What is Probability?
In this lesson, we will define probability and discuss its importance in various fields. We will explore the basic concepts and principles of probability theory, including sample spaces, events, and outcomes.

📚 Lesson 2: Basic Probability Terminology
In this lesson, we will dive deeper into the terminology used in probability. We will cover topics such as probability of an event, complementary events, and mutually exclusive events. 

📚 Lesson 3: The Probability Scale
In this lesson, we will introduce the concept of the probability scale and learn how to assign probabilities to events using different methods. We will also discuss the interpretation of probabilities and their relationship to odds.

### Module 2: Probability Rules and Formulas

✖️ Lesson 1: The Addition Rule
In this lesson, we will learn about the addition rule and how to calculate the probability of the union of two or more events. We will explore both the mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive cases.

✖️ Lesson 2: The Multiplication Rule
In this lesson, we will explore the multiplication rule and its application in calculating the probability of the intersection of two or more events. We will also discuss independent and dependent events.

✖️ Lesson 3: Conditional Probability
In this lesson, we will delve into conditional probability and its significance in real-world scenarios. We will learn how to calculate conditional probabilities and apply them to solve problems.

### Module 3: Probability Distributions

📊 Lesson 1: Discrete Probability Distributions
In this lesson, we will study discrete probability distributions, such as the binomial and Poisson distributions. We will learn how to calculate probabilities, mean, and variance for these distributions.

📊 Lesson 2: Continuous Probability Distributions
In this lesson, we will explore continuous probability distributions, particularly the normal distribution. We will discuss the properties of the normal distribution and apply it to solve problems.

📊 Lesson 3: Expected Value and Variance
In this lesson, we will focus on the concepts of expected value and variance. We will learn how to calculate these measures and understand their significance in probability theory.

### Module 4: Applications of Probability

📊 Lesson 1: Probability in Statistics
In this lesson, we will examine the role of probability in statistics. We will learn about sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

📊 Lesson 2: Probability in Genetics
In this lesson, we will explore the applications of probability in genetics. We will discuss topics such as Punnett squares, inheritance patterns, and the probability of genetic disorders.

📊 Lesson 3: Probability in Finance
In this lesson, we will discover how probability is utilized in finance. We will delve into concepts such as risk assessment, portfolio management, and option pricing.
