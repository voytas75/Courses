### Day 1

#### Introduction to PowerShell: Understand the basics, environment setup, and executing commands

##### What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is used to automate tasks on Windows operating systems. PowerShell is based on the .NET Framework and can be used to manage Windows services, applications, and hardware.

##### PowerShell basics

PowerShell commands are written in a text-based format. Each command is made up of a verb and a noun. The verb specifies the action to be performed, and the noun specifies the object on which the action is performed. For example, the command `Get-Process` gets a list of all the processes running on the computer.

Here are some of the most common PowerShell verbs:

* Get: Gets information about an object.
* Set: Sets the properties of an object.
* New: Creates a new object.
* Remove: Removes an object.
* Start: Starts a process.
* Stop: Stops a process.
* Restart: Restarts a process.

Here are some of the most common PowerShell nouns:

* Process: A running program.
* Service: A program that runs in the background.
* File: A data file.
* Folder: A container for files and folders.
* Registry key: A value in the Windows registry.
* Group: A collection of users or computers.

##### Environment setup

Before you can use PowerShell, you need to set up your environment. This includes installing PowerShell and configuring your profile.

To install PowerShell, go to the Microsoft website and download the latest version. Once PowerShell is installed, you need to configure your profile. Your profile is a PowerShell script that is executed every time you open a PowerShell window. You can use your profile to set environment variables and load modules.

To configure your profile, open a PowerShell window and type the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This command allows you to run scripts that are downloaded from the internet.

Next, create a new file called `profile.ps1` and save it in your home directory. In this file, you can add any commands that you want to run every time you open a PowerShell window. For example, you could add the following command to your profile:

```powershell
Import-Module posh-git
```

This command loads the posh-git module, which provides PowerShell commands for working with Git.

##### Executing commands

To execute a PowerShell command, you type the command at the PowerShell prompt and press Enter. For example, to get a list of all the processes running on the computer, you would type the following command:

```powershell
Get-Process
```

You can also use piping to pass the output of one command to another command. For example, the following command gets a list of all the processes running on the computer and then sorts the list by the CPU usage:

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU
```

PowerShell also supports aliases, which are short names for commands. For example, the alias `gp` is equivalent to the command `Get-Process`.

##### PowerShell help

If you need help with a PowerShell command, you can use the `Get-Help` command. The `Get-Help` command provides information about the syntax and usage of a command. For example, to get help on the `Get-Process` command, you would type the following command:

```powershell
Get-Help Get-Process
```

#### Working with Variables and Data Types: Learn how to create variables, assign values, and manipulate different data types

##### Working with Numeric Data Types

Welcome to Lesson of our PowerShell self-paced course! In this lesson, we'll dive into the fascinating world of numeric data types. Numbers are fundamental in programming, and PowerShell provides powerful tools to work with various numeric values. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate numbers, and round decimals with confidence.

##### Integers: Building Blocks of Numbers

Integers are whole numbers without any decimal points. They're used to represent quantities that are countable, such as the number of items in a list or the age of a person. Let's look at some essential concepts:

* **Creating Integer Variables**: To create an integer variable, use a meaningful name and the assignment operator (`=`). For example, `$age = 25` stores the value 25 in the variable `$age`.

* **Arithmetic Operations**: PowerShell allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations with integers. Use `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division. For example:

  ```powershell
  $num1 = 10
  $num2 = 5
  $sum = $num1 + $num2    # $sum now holds 15
  ```

* **Integer Division and Modulus**: Integer division (`\`) divides two integers and gives you the quotient without the decimal part. The modulus (`%`) operation provides the remainder. For instance:

  ```powershell
  $dividend = 17
  $divisor = 4
  $quotient = $dividend / $divisor   # $quotient is 4.25 (decimal part is truncated)
  $remainder = $dividend % $divisor  # $remainder is 1
  ```

##### Floating-Point Numbers: Precision for Decimals

Floating-point numbers, also known as floats, are used when you need to work with decimal values. These are essential for tasks like calculations involving money or measurements. Let's explore the basics:

* **Creating Float Variables**: Declare a float variable by including a decimal point in the value. For instance, `$price = 24.99` stores the price as a float.

* **Arithmetic with Floats**: Just like integers, you can perform arithmetic operations with floats. PowerShell handles mixed operations (combining integers and floats) seamlessly.

  ```powershell
  $length = 10.5
  $width = 7
  $area = $length * $width   # $area now holds 73.5
  ```

* **Rounding Numbers**: PowerShell provides methods to round floating-point numbers. The `.ToString("N2")` method rounds to a specified number of decimal places.

  ```powershell
  $pi = 3.14159
  $roundedPi = $pi.ToString("N2")  # $roundedPi is "3.14"
  ```

##### Practice Time: Let's Crunch Some Numbers

Exercise 1:

1. Create two integer variables representing the number of apples and oranges you have.
2. Calculate the total fruit count by adding them together.
3. Calculate the average by dividing the total by 2.

Exercise 2:

1. Declare a float variable to store the temperature in Celsius.
2. Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula `F = C * 9/5 + 32`.
3. Display the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Congratulations! You've completed Lesson on working with numeric data types in PowerShell. You've learned how to create variables for integers and floats, perform arithmetic operations, and round decimal numbers. Keep practicing these concepts to build a strong foundation for your PowerShell scripting skills. In the next lesson, we'll explore the exciting world of manipulating text with string data types. Keep up the great work!

#### Conditional Statements and Loops: Explore the usage of if-else statements, switch statements, and different looping constructs

This lesson will guide students through the concepts of making decisions and repeating tasks in PowerShell through conditional statements and loops.

##### Lesson 3: Conditional Statements and Loops

Welcome to Lesson 3 of our PowerShell self-paced course! In this lesson, we'll delve into the fascinating realm of conditional statements and loops. These powerful tools allow you to make decisions and automate repetitive tasks in your scripts. By the end of this lesson, you'll be equipped to use if-else statements, switch statements, and various looping constructs effectively.

##### Making Decisions with Conditional Statements

Conditional statements help your scripts respond dynamically based on different conditions. Let's start with the versatile `if-else` statement:

* **if-else Statements**: Use `if` to check if a condition is true, and execute the associated code block. If the condition is false, the `else` block is executed.

  ```powershell
  $temperature = 25
  if ($temperature -gt 20) {
      Write-Host "It's a warm day!"
  } else {
      Write-Host "It's a bit chilly."
  }
  ```

* **Logical Operators**: You can combine conditions using logical operators. Use `-and` for "and" conditions, `-or` for "or" conditions, and `-not` for negation.

##### Switching Paths with Switch Statements

Switch statements are excellent for scenarios where you want to compare a single variable against multiple possible values. Here's how it works:

* **switch Statement**: The `switch` statement evaluates a single variable against multiple cases and executes the code block associated with the matched case.

  ```powershell
  $dayOfWeek = "Wednesday"
  switch ($dayOfWeek) {
      "Monday" { Write-Host "Start of the workweek." }
      "Wednesday" { Write-Host "Middle of the week." }
      "Friday" { Write-Host "Weekend is near!" }
      default { Write-Host "Regular day." }
  }
  ```

##### Automating Tasks with Loops

Loops allow you to automate repetitive tasks by executing a block of code multiple times. Let's explore two essential looping constructs:

* **For Loops**: A `for` loop iterates over a range of values and executes the code block for each value.

  ```powershell
  for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
      Write-Host "Iteration $i"
  }
  ```

* **While Loops**: A `while` loop repeats the code block as long as the specified condition is true.

  ```powershell
  $counter = 1
  while ($counter -le 3) {
      Write-Host "Count: $counter"
      $counter++
  }
  ```

##### Practice Time: Making Choices and Repeating Actions

Exercise 1:

1. Create a PowerShell script that prompts the user for their age.
2. Based on their age, display a message about whether they're a minor, an adult, or a senior.

Exercise 2:

1. Write a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10.
2. Use a loop to allow the user to guess the number. Provide hints if the guess is too high or too low.

Congratulations! You've completed Lesson on conditional statements and loops in PowerShell. You've learned how to make decisions using `if-else` statements, switch between different paths using `switch` statements, and automate tasks using `for` and `while` loops. These skills will empower you to create more dynamic and efficient scripts. In the next lesson, we'll delve into the world of functions and modular programming. Keep up the fantastic work!

Functions are like mini-programs within your script. They encapsulate a set of instructions, allowing you to reuse code and make your scripts easier to manage.

* **Defining Functions**: A function in PowerShell is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name and a pair of curly braces `{}` to enclose the function code.

  ```powershell
  function SayHello {
      Write-Host "Hello, there!"
  }
  ```

* **Calling Functions**: To use a function, simply call it by its name followed by parentheses.

  ```powershell
  SayHello   # Calls the SayHello function
  ```

##### **Function Parameters**

Parameters allow you to pass values into a function, making it more versatile. Let's explore how to define and use parameters:

* **Adding Parameters**: Declare parameters within the function's parentheses, separating them with commas.

  ```powershell
  function GreetPerson ($name) {
      Write-Host "Hello, $name!"
  }
  ```

* **Calling Functions with Parameters**: When calling a function with parameters, provide the parameter values inside the parentheses.

  ```powershell
  GreetPerson "Alice"   # Calls the GreetPerson function with "Alice" as the name parameter
  ```

##### **Return Values from Functions**

Functions can also return values back to the caller, allowing you to extract data or results. Here's how:

* **Returning Values**: Use the `return` keyword to send a value back to the caller.

  ```powershell
  function Square($number) {
      return $number * $number
  }
  ```

* **Using Returned Values**: Capture the returned value by assigning the function call to a variable.

  ```powershell
  $result = Square 5   # $result now holds 25
  ```

##### **Modularizing Code with Functions**

One of the main benefits of functions is the ability to modularize your code. This makes your scripts more organized and easier to maintain.

* **Breaking Down Tasks**: Identify portions of your code that can be turned into functions for reuse.
* **Code Reusability**: Instead of repeating code, create functions and call them when needed.
* **Enhanced Readability**: Functions make your scripts easier to understand by providing well-named, self-contained blocks of code.

##### **Practice Time: Building Reusable Functions**
