for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to execute in each iteration
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
}
```

#### 2. While Loop: Condition-Based Iteration

The `while` loop continues executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute as long as the condition is true
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
let count = 0;

while (count < 3) {
    console.log("Count: " + count);
    count++;
}
```

#### 3. Do-While Loop: Execute First, Check Later

The `do-while` loop executes a block of code at least once and then continues as long as a specified condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
do {
    // Code to execute at least once
} while (condition);
```

**Example:**

```javascript
let input;

do {
    input = prompt("Enter a number greater than 5: ");
} while (input <= 5);
```

#### 4. For...of Loop: Iterating Over Values

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (let value of iterable) {
    // Code to execute for each value in the iterable
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

#### 5. Nested Loops: Looping Within Loops

You can nest one loop within another to handle more complex patterns or multidimensional arrays.

**Example:**

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        console.log("i: " + i + ", j: " + j);
    }
}
```

#### 6. Break and Continue: Controlling Flow

The `break` statement terminates the current loop, while the `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.

**Example:**

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break; // Terminate the loop when i is 5
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

**Conclusion**

Loops and iteration are essential tools for efficiently handling repetitive tasks and processing data in JavaScript. With `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for...of`, and nested loops, you have the power to control the flow of your code's execution.
