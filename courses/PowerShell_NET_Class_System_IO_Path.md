## üéØ **Detailed Course Plan:**

### üìñ **Week 1 - Understanding File Paths**

#### Lesson 1: Introduction to File Paths

- Definition and importance of file paths: Understanding the concept of file paths and how they are crucial for locating and accessing files within the operating system. Emphasize the role of file paths in both local and networked environments.
- Anatomy of a file path: Explore the structure of a file path, breaking it down into its components, including the drive letter, directory path, filename, and file extension. Discuss how different operating systems might have variations in representing file paths.
- Using the "System.IO.Path" class to work with file paths: Introduce the "System.IO.Path" class available in PowerShell and explain its significance in handling file paths. Cover essential methods like "Combine," "GetFileName," "GetDirectoryName," and "GetExtension."

#### Lesson 2: File Path Manipulation

- Combining paths using the "Join-Path" method: In-depth exploration of the "Join-Path" method, understanding its purpose in concatenating different parts of a file path. Provide examples of how to combine paths safely and avoid common pitfalls.
- Extracting components from a file path using methods like "GetFileName," "GetDirectoryName," and "GetExtension": Hands-on exercises to demonstrate how to extract specific parts of a file paths, such as filenames, directory names, and file extensions. Highlight scenarios where these methods can be particularly useful.
- Handling file paths with different formats and separators: Discuss the challenges and solutions of dealing with file paths in various formats (e.g., UNC paths, relative paths, URLs) and how to handle different path separators (backslash and forward slash).

### üìñ **Week 2 - File and Directory Operations**

#### Lesson 1: File Operations with "System.IO.Path"

- Creating and writing to a new file: Step-by-step guide on creating a new file using PowerShell and how to write content to it. Address potential issues like file overwriting and permissions.
- Copying and moving files to different locations: Learn how to duplicate and move files with PowerShell while preserving their metadata and attributes. Explain the difference between copying and moving operations.
- Deleting files securely using PowerShell: Explore methods to delete files safely, confirming deletions, and handling scenarios where certain files should not be deleted.

#### Lesson 2: Directory Operations with "System.IO.Path"

- Creating and removing directories: Understand how to create new directories (folders) and how to remove them using PowerShell. Discuss the importance of error handling and how to handle situations where directories contain files.
- Renaming directories: Step-by-step instructions on renaming directories, including potential complications and methods to overcome them.
- Navigating through directories with the "Set-Location" cmdlet: Guide learners on how to change the current working directory within PowerShell using the "Set-Location" (cd) cmdlet.

### üìñ **Week 3 - File Extension and Path Validation**

#### Lesson 1: Validating File Paths

- Checking file existence and permissions: Teach students how to verify if a file exists at a specified path and how to check permissions to access or modify the file.
- Verifying valid file extensions: Guide learners on how to validate file extensions against a list of allowed extensions and how to handle cases where an invalid extension is encountered.
- Handling spaces and special characters in file paths: Illustrate how to manage file paths that contain spaces or special characters, emphasizing the significance of quoting and escaping in PowerShell.

#### Lesson 2: Parsing and Manipulating File Paths

- Using regex to extract specific information from file paths: Introduce regular expressions and demonstrate how they can be employed to parse file paths and extract specific information, such as file names without extensions.
- Replacing parts of file paths using regular expressions: Show how to use regular expressions for batch renaming files or replacing specific parts of file paths.
- Advanced path manipulation techniques: Provide advanced examples of path manipulation, such as resolving relative paths, normalizing paths, and working with long file paths.

### üìñ **Week 4 - Real-World Applications**

#### Lesson 1: File and Directory Management Scripts

- Building scripts to automate file backups: Guide learners on creating PowerShell scripts that automate the process of backing up specific files or directories at regular intervals.
- Implementing a directory synchronization script: Demonstrate how to develop a script that synchronizes two directories, ensuring that both directories contain the same files.
- Using PowerShell to manage file versions: Show how to use the "System.IO.Path" class in conjunction with version control techniques to manage file versions effectively.

#### Lesson 2: PowerShell and File System Interactions

- Integrating "System.IO.Path" with other .NET classes: Explore how "System.IO.Path" can be integrated with other .NET classes for enhanced file and directory management capabilities.
- Interacting with the Windows file system using PowerShell: Cover additional PowerShell cmdlets and techniques for interacting with the Windows file system beyond what the "System.IO.Path" class offers.
- Troubleshooting common file and directory issues: Address common errors and challenges that learners may encounter when working with file paths and provide troubleshooting strategies.
