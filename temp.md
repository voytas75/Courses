     - Explanation of regex and its applications.
         üìù Explanation of Regex:

            	‚Ä¢	Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a powerful sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
            	‚Ä¢	It is a versatile tool used to match, search, and manipulate text based on specific patterns.
            	‚Ä¢	Regex allows you to define rules for matching strings, enabling you to search for patterns within data effectively.

         üí° Applications of Regex:
            Regex finds extensive use in many domains, including:

            üîç Text Searching and Validation:

               	‚Ä¢	In programming, regex is employed for text searching and validation tasks.
               	‚Ä¢	It helps identify specific words, phrases, or patterns within large sets of data.

            üìÑ Text Processing and Parsing:

               	‚Ä¢	Regex enables the extraction of relevant information from text, such as extracting email addresses, phone numbers, or URLs from a document.

            üõ†Ô∏è Data Manipulation:

               	‚Ä¢	In scripting languages like PowerShell, regex is used for data manipulation, filtering, and transformation tasks.
               	‚Ä¢	It can be employed to modify data formats or remove unwanted characters from text.

            üìú Log Analysis:

               	‚Ä¢	Regex is extensively used in log analysis to parse and extract useful information from log files.
               	‚Ä¢	It aids in identifying patterns related to errors, warnings, or specific events.

            üåê Web Scraping:

               	‚Ä¢	Web developers often use regex for web scraping tasks, extracting data from HTML or XML documents.

            üìä Data Validation and Form Processing:

               	‚Ä¢	In web development, regex helps validate user input in forms, ensuring that it meets specific criteria.
